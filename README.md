# Auto_CLI_Linux

### 🚀 Get started

To use the **Auto CLI for Linux** version:

 1) Open a terminal
 2) Execute this command:

    ```
    bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Purple-EyeZ/Auto_CLI_Linux/main/Auto_CLI_Linux.sh)
    ```
    
    >ℹ️ *Note: you may need to install “curl” first, using the following command:*
    `sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y curl`

 3) Wait until everything's installed and follow the on-screen instructions, that's all.

### 🛠️ Usage

Once launched, the script will download and install all the prerequisites for using CLI, the CLI files and required folders will be created in “/home/User/Downloads/Auto_CLI_Linux”.

Once all this is done, the script asks you what action you want to perform:
- (1-7): Select the app you want to patch, everything is automated
- Once patched, the destination path appears on the screen. Send the patched apk to your phone and install it.

### 👨‍💻 Direct use of CLI

You can also just use this script to install the CLI and its prerequisites quickly and use the CLI manually:

- Run the script and use the “E” choice to close it.
- Simply use the following command in your terminal to move to the right place: `cd $HOME/Downloads/Auto_CLI_Linux`
- Learn how to use the CLI with its [documentation](https://github.com/ReVanced/revanced-cli/tree/main/docs)

### Note
There's no “Custom” mode at the moment, and no way to manage patch options or keystores. I may add more features later (or not)
